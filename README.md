    ℹ️ Information ℹ️
  </h3>
  <br>
  <span> Simulating a zoo system, I implemented several functions for different purposes. The system has information about the animals, employees and opening hours, so the functions I developed can act in a way that makes it easier to manipulate the data. </span> 
  <br><br>
  <span> I also developed tests to check if some functions reached their objectives in the right way. </span>

    ⭐ Requirements ⭐
  </h3>
  <div align="left">
  <br>
  
- [X] 1. Implement a function `getSpeciesByIds` that searches for animal species by id.
- [X] 2. Implement a function `getAnimalsOlderThan` that checks if all animals of a species have the minimum age specified.
- [X] 3. Implement the function `getEmployeeByName` that searches for employees by first or last name.
- [X] 4. Implement the function `getRelatedEmployees` that creates the management of the collaborating people according to their manager.
- [X] 5. Implement the function `countAnimals` that counts the animals of each species.
- [X] 6. Get at least 80% test coverage in the `handlerElephants` function.
- [X] 7. Get at least 90% test coverage in the `handlerElephants` function.
- [X] 8. Implement the `calculateEntry` function that calculates the total input price.
- [X] 9. Implement the function `getOldestFromFirstSpecies` that fetches the oldest animal of the first managed species.
- [X] 10. Implement the function `getEmployeesCoverage` that creates an association of information to cover the collaborating people.
- [X] 11. Get at least 85% test coverage in the `getOpeningHours` function.
- [X] 12. Get at least 95% testing coverage for the `getOpeningHours` function.
